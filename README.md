# Principal-Component-Analysis-on-Breast-Cancer-Data

The goal of this project is to implement Principal Component Analysis on the [Breast Cancer Data](https://github.com/Benjamin-compute/Breast-Cancer-Prediction__Comparing-4-ML-Algorithms) (without the 'target' variable).


The number of patients/instances is 569, with 30 original features (predictors). 


The Cumulative Explained Variance Ratio method was used to determine the optimal number of components, ensuring at least a 95% explained variance. Hence, the original 30 features were reduced to 10 features/components.
